## Reader to Feedly
small extension to redirect from reader.google.com to feedly.com;

I used to read Reader daily and when a read <a href='http://googlereader.blogspot.com.ar/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html'>this bad news</a> I started to search alternatives to this great service.
After some day I started to use <a href="http://www.feedly.com/">http://www.feedly.com/</a> which is, at less for me, a great alternative.
The problem was that when I wanted to read my feeds, I find myself writing reader.google.com on my Chrome.

This Extension come to solve this problem, the only function is to redirect from Google reader, to feedly.com.

Have fun
